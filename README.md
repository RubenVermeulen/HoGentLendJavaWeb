# HoGentLend Java Web Application

## Project description

As part of the course projects 2 we had to develop a material reservation tool for HoGent. We had to work out all use cases with the customer. During the project we used serveral technologies and tools such as Javascript, C#, Git, Visual Paradigm and MSSQL Server.

## Application description

This as a Java web application. It functions as an easy overview of the current reservations.
